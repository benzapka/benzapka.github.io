									<h2>Unit 1</h2>
									<p>The first unit introduced the module’s expectations. In the initial reflective activity, I examined global governance challenges and ethical implications of generative AI, as discussed in Correa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023), emphasising recommended actions based on legal, social, and professional impacts in computing. This assignment deepened my understanding of technology’s ethical consequences and highlighted responsible professional behaviour in IT. This week also began the first collaborative discussion on ethics and professional conduct, using case studies from the Association of Computing Machinery (n. d.) and the British Computer Society's (2021) Code of Conduct. My chosen case focused on secure medical technology development, revealing strengths and weaknesses, and encouraging discussion on best practices. This further enriched my understanding of ethical behaviour and professional standards in IT.

									<h2>Unit 2</h2>
									<p>Unit 2 included an e-Portfolio activity for the Literature Review. I selected a topic and created an outline for my review on using Machine Learning algorithms for health insurance fraud detection, which guided my summative assessment in Unit 7. Planning early helped me manage my time effectively (Kibble, 2017; Buléon et al., 2022), and I plan to use this approach for my final capstone project. The unit also required responding to at least three peer posts in the collaborative discussion. I chose peers who discussed different case studies than mine, which broadened my ethical perspectives in the tech sector and highlighted individual responsibilities (Kendal, 2022). These insights are valuable for my future career as a Data Scientist.

										<h2>Unit 3</h2>
										<p>In this unit’s e-Portfolio activity, I used readings from University of Liverpool Academic Skills (n.d.), QuestionPro (2021), and Sage (2021) to evaluate the methodological design of my Unit 10 research proposal. I addressed questions on research methods, data collection, and required skills, helping shape the methodology section of my proposal and inspiring its content for the final presentation. In a seminar preparation, I critically evaluated and compared research designs of two different studies, this way getting a better understanding of how different approaches can be utilised to answer questions. This unit also concluded the first collaborative discussion, with a final summary post reflecting on my work and peer feedback. Engaging with peers’ ideas further deepened my understanding of ethics and professional conduct in the IT industry.</p>

										<h2>Unit 4</h2>
										<p>Here, I finalised and uploaded my literature review outline which I uploaded under unit 2 of this e-portfolio. Additionally, as part of the seminar preparation, I worked through a case study on data privacy in a research environment. The discussed case involved access to confidential property records, requiring me to answer questions identifying the ethical issues around data privacy, consent, and proper authorisation. From this exercise, I learned how to evaluate ethical dilemmas in information access and the importance of consent, privacy, and following institutional protocols when handling sensitive data (European Parliament, 2016; Paprica et al., 2023).</p>

										<h2>Unit 5</h2>
										<p>In the second reflective activity, I examined how surveys can be misused and what companies should consider when designing them. I analysed the Cambridge Analytica case (Confessore, 2018) and Google’s data misuse for personalised ads (Schneier, 2015), both of which led to fines and reputational harm. These cases showed how poor research design can have serious consequences, reinforcing the ethical importance of sound methodology for my capstone project. In a wiki activity, I critiqued the Saelzer Electric Customer Satisfaction Questionnaire (Saelzer Electric, n.d.), assessing its format and questions. This helped me develop critical research analysis skills, an area previously noted for improvement, which I can now apply throughout my studies, especially if I create a questionnaire for my capstone project.

										<h2>Unit 6</h2>
										<p>This unit contained no e-Portfolio activities. Thus, I use this space to publish my evaluation of my performance in both graded assignments, the literature review in unit 7 and the research proposal presentation. Working out strengths and weaknesses of the approaches and consulting best practices for academic work, I will profit from this when working on my master’s thesis (Mendoza et al., 2022; Far et al., 2023). I am also able to stress some possible points for improvement working in Data Science in general, as skills like time management and how to put together an engaging presentation are applicable there too (Aeon, Faber and Panaccio, 2021; Fayyad and Hamutcu, 2020).

										<h2>Unit 7</h2>
										<p>In Unit 7, I completed worksheets on hypothesis testing and summary measures, which strengthened my statistical skills for analysing data in my master’s thesis. This unit also began the second collaborative discussion on research ethics and reporting ambiguous results, especially when companies may prefer only positive outcomes. I published my initial post on this topic. Additionally, I submitted the first summative assignment, a literature review on using machine learning to predict health insurance fraud. Reviewing various papers and organising them by prediction methods taught me to structure my work and manage time (Alyami et al., 2021). Although I struggled with time management toward the end, the experience will help me stay on track during my thesis. Feedback highlighted the need for consistent citation, including in conclusions, and for better time planning to allow proofreading (Elsevier, n.d.), which I will apply to my future work.

										<h2>Unit 8</h2>
										<p>In this unit, I published my research proposal outline for the summative assignment due in unit 10. The research proposal covered the topic of using machine learning for sentiment analysis. Structuring the approach for the research proposal in this outline and already considering some important literature on the topic up front allowed me to structure the presentation that I will need to hold in unit 10 and ahead of time get an understanding of how everything will fit together (Kibble, 2017; Buléon et al., 2022). It also showed me which topics need some more focus, this way enabling me to manage my time effectively towards the final submission in unit 10. Furthermore, in this unit I answered three initial posts of my peers in the second collaborative discussion. Again, by reading and critically evaluating the works of other students, I was able to deepen my considerations and gain additional knowledge (Breakstone et al., 2021).

										<h2>Unit 9</h2>
										<p>In this week, I worked on a charts worksheet where I created different data visualisations using charts in Excel. This sort of task will probably also play an important part of my master’s thesis because it allows me to present found insights more compelling visually. However, I typically will use different tools than Excel for this type of task in the future as, e.g., Python and R give me more advanced functionalities (Matplotlib, n. d.; R Documentation, 2023). Additionally, in this unit, the second collaborative discussion ended with my summary post. Going through the collaborations of my peers who answered to my post again enabled me to add depth to my ideas. Furthermore, the necessity to cut down on 300 words let me consider which ideas I believe to be most important, which was an additional interesting consideration which I deemed helpful (Pottier et al., 2024).

										<h2>Unit 10</h2>
										<p>In this unit, I uploaded my results for all statistical worksheets I worked on during the previous units for formative feedback. Furthermore, the second summative assignment was due. In a research proposal presentation, I presented a research approach for testing whether transformer based models excel at analysing sentiments for two different domains. Working on this research proposal presentation prepared me for the general research proposal process which will be an important part of my master’s thesis (Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill, 2023; Apostolidis and Tsiatsos, 2021). The feedback I received for this assignment stressed a generally excellent research approach. Possible improvements, however, included the necessity to improve the audio quality (Schiller et al., 2024) and split up the slides to not talk too long on one single slide (Liu, 2024). These findings will help me perform better in future presentations that I will hold. For a better video quality of the research proposal presentation, please check the unit 10 submission.

										<h2>Unit 11</h2>
										<p>This unit focused on a reflection of my current progress towards the aims of this master’s degree. In a professional skills matrix, I present evidence for the different skills this degree aims at developing from several modules, my industry experience in technology consulting and anti-money laundering as well as from general personal experience. A SWOT analysis contrasts strengths with weaknesses and opportunities with threats. The action plan defines goals I want to reach within the next 12 months and maps my strategies to reach each goal to them. Together, these three documents help me to understand where I am in my personal and professional development and which steps are necessary to move towards my goals (Owens, 2020; Reisner, 2021). I will use and update them to reach my defined goals.</p>
